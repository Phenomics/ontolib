/**
 * Algorithms for operating on graphs.
 *
 * <p>
 * The most important class of algorithms for ontologies are based on graph
 * traversal. Thus, you will find the usual, common such algorithms in this
 * module. The central concept here is the <b>visitor pattern</b>, codified by
 * the {@link VertexVisitor} interface.
