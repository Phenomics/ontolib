 * Identifier of a {@link Term}, consisting of a {@link TermPrefix} and a local numeric ID.

 * <p>
 * By convention, the longest prefix up to the last colon {@code ":"} will be used for the prefix.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h5>Design Notes</h5>
 *
 * <p>
 * The whole point of this interface and the implementing classes is optimization. This type
 * hierarchy is designed such that when loading a file with an ontology, one {@link TermPrefix}
 * instance is generated for each occuring term prefix value. While an implementation that assumes
 * numeric IDs after a prefix might be faster, this does not resolve many important cases such as
 * NCIT and also cases such as {@code DO:00012} vs. {@code DO:12}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Thus, good care has to be taken that in the case of inner loops over terms to first map them to
 * integers and then use these integers.
