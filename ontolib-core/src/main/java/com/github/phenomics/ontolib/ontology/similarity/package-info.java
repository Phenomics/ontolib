/**
 * Computation of similarity metrics for ontologies.
 *
 * <h5>Remarks</h5>
 *
 * <p>
 * Arguably, the most-used similarity measure for phenotype ontologies (by the authors) is Resnik
 * similarity. The other set- and information content-based similarities are implemented mostly for
 * completness' sake. However, <i>graph-based similarity measures (GraSM)</i> have currently be
 * ignored for simplicity's sake and low expected pratical usage.
