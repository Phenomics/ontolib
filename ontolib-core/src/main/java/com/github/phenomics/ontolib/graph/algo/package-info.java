/**
 * Algorithms for operating on graphs.

 * <p>
 * The most important class of algorithms for ontologies are based on graph traversal. Thus, you
 * will find the usual, common such algorithms in this module. The central concept here is the
 * <b>visitor pattern</b>, codified by the
 * {@link com.github.phenomics.ontolib.graph.algo.VertexVisitor} interface.
