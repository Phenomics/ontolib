/**
 * uPheno--specific implementations of {@link com.github.phenomics.ontolib.ontology.data.Ontology} and
 * related classes.
 *
 * <p>
 * uPheno is a cross-species ontology integrating the HPO (human phenotype ontology), MPO (mammalian
 * phenotype ontology) as well as the ZPO (zebrafish phenotype ontology).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The classes from this package facilitate working with uPheno by specialized types with attributes
 * relevant when working with the uPheno, the relevant annotation formats as well as code with
 * utilities and helpers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can use {@link de.charite.compbio.ontolib.io.obo.upheno.UphenoOboParser} for parsing
 * OBO-formatted files and <code>String</codes>s into
 * {@link com.github.phenomics.ontolib.formats.upheno.UphenoOntology} objects.
